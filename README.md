Hadoop-and-Hive-Project
Analysing Used Cars

Introduction
The cars data that is used for our analysis was put together from several different websites. In Czech Republic and Germany over a period of more than a year. Some of the sources provided unstructured data, so as a result the data is dirty. There are missing values and some values are very wrong. For example phone numbers have been inputed as mileage in some cases. The data is consist of roughly 3.5 Million rows and sixteen columns: maker, model, mileage - in KM, manufacture_year, engine_displacement, engine_power, body_type, color_slug, stk_year, transmission, door_count, seat_count, fuel_type, date_created, date_last_seen, price_eur.

Creat a table in Hive to remove Null values.
